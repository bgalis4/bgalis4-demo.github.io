            <p> My name is Brett, a recruiter at a top threat intelligence company based in NYC! 
                I recently moved to Scottsdale, AZ from Stamford, CT. I had to try something new 
                after being stuck in Stamford during COVID and with the warm weather and easy 
                access to some of the best hiking/mountain biking trails I could not pass it up.</p>
